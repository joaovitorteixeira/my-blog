## Projects
- Earth-quake prediction:
  - I want to dive deeper into machine learning, data streams, and how to connect both. So I created this [repo](https://github.com/joaovitorteixeira/earthquake-python).

## Reading
- Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban
  - I traveled to Japan about two months ago and visited Universal Studios. I loved the experience in the Harry Potter area, so I decided to start reading the books again.
- Designing Data-Intensive Applications
  - I'm revisiting this book. Iâ€™ll probably come up with more project ideas based on the concepts I learn from it.

## Videos
- [what is the future of art?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5YlreKsUGY) (Answer In Progress)
