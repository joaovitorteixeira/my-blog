# My weekly report

Welcome to my weekly report! This is where I share my small steps and progress on a weekly basis. A typical post here will include:

- Articles I've read
- Videos I've watched
- Repositories and projects I'm working on
- Books I'm reading

I created this section because I found it hard to keep my blog consistently updated. I like having cool, polished stuff to showcase there - but here, it's more about documenting the journey to those posts.

This space is also very personal. If you're here, don't expect only tech topics. I might share other things too.
