Currently, the backend applications I write are built using NodeJS with the [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) framework, MySQL as the database, and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as the ORM. This stack is excellent for quickly building MVPs and is also perfect for agencies.  
However at the beginning of the year, some of our projects completed the previous year began exhibiting strange behavior and over time the servers became unavailable.

When problems like this occur they always seem to happen on a weekend, right? Murphy's law in action üòî!! I don't know exactly how, but I remember noticing this behavior during a weekend:

This image shows the RAM usage over several months. Each of these spikes represents an instance reaching 100% memory usage (a 2GB instance, with only 1GB dedicated to the application‚Äîanother bug we also fixed). After hitting the memory limit, another instance was created and this continued until reaching the limit of 4 instances.  
Now that I've explained the issue, let me properly introduce it: meet our bug, **RAMpire** üßõüèª.  

Our stack at the time was using Node 18 and Prisma 4. When we detected this bug, my first step (after restart the instances- provisory fix) was to check the issues list on GitHub and search for related problems. Gotcha! Here‚Äôs the issue I found:  

[Prisma Memory Leak when using in NestJS app, reported by Jest #17925](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/17925)


A group of people was experiencing the same problem as me. It was even funny to read the comments and see everyone‚Äôs strategies for reproducing this bug.  

The bug was considered resolved after updating to [Prisma version 5](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-5-f66prwkjx72s) and Node 18 or 20. However, as mentioned earlier, I was already on version 18, and the bug persisted.  

Since I wasn‚Äôt using the latest versions of Prisma and NodeJS, my first attempt was to update them and test again.
Unsurprisingly the memory leak disappeared. While I don't enjoy the feeling of not fully understanding the root cause of a bug and simply updating some library versions to fix everything magically, but sometimes we must move on, pack these experiences into our journey and focus on what will come next.

At the same time, I'm not entirely unhappy, as Node 18 will lose support in [5 months](https://endoflife.date/nodejs), and Prisma 5 is significantly better than its previous versions.

## The Real Problem  

I had stopped writing my post at the previous paragraph, but I felt like something was missing from the whole story.
I hadn‚Äôt shared the full picture, and there‚Äôs an important lesson I learned here!
When it comes to a backend server, we want to know everything that‚Äôs happening‚Äîwe need visibility and observability.  

Since each client has their own AWS account, and we have many clients, it‚Äôs very difficult to actively monitor server parameters daily and try to identify potential issues. 
I want the problems to come to me, so I can notify the client that they‚Äôre happening (already knowing what the issue is and, possibly, how to fix it).  

Being notified, having a platform that centralizes all this information with graphs for CPU usage, RAM usage, average response time for each endpoint, database status, and other useful metrics‚Äîthis is what I‚Äôve set as one of my goals for the next year.  

It‚Äôs a great challenge, and I‚Äôm super excited to dive into this experience! ü§©
